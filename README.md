## About
This recurrent neural network framework implements a deep bidriectional LSTM algorithm in Python with use of the
[Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) library. The intension is a light weight flat implementation with
the opportunity to test easily new ideas and implement the latest research.

Current implemented features:
- RMSprop
- AdaDelta
- Dropout
- Identity function layer-wise
